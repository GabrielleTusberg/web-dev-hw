      <pre>
“One of the most important of life´s lessons is to learn independance,to understand freedom.
This means independence from attachments,from results,from opinions,and from expectations.
Breaking attachments leads to freedom,
but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship,
a relationship that nourrishes your soul.
It means ending dependency on any person or thing.
Love is never a dependency.”</pre>
