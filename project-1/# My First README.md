## Summary
This week I leanred about the interent, the world wide web, web development, web desing, a bit about HTML, CSS, and markdown. There was a lot of information that I am still absorbing about how this code works. It will be easier for me to articulate how HTML and CSS work as we begin to go further into it and I actually use it. I also took the creatuve coding class with Micheal Musick last semester so it was nice to have some fimilarity with atom and markdown and repractice those things used.
### This Week
  1. I learned more about HTML and CSS
  2. I remembered how to use markdown
  3. I figured out how to install things onto my atom while my format was different then the videos

#### Issues
- It took me awhile to understand how to work the *web dev* page
- With the *Github* Repository I wasn't sure if I was commenting on another persons or if I needed to create another Issue on the __Issue tab__
- At first I thought we only had one hw when I was figuring out how to understand the format of the web dev page

#### What Worked/ What Didn't Work

What helped most was following the P5.js References instructions on what all the syntax stood for with each shape I was trying to make.
It also helped to visualize my monster drawing like a graph. However, most of what I did was guess. Guessing helped me play around and continue working on my project versus thinking too hard on what the coordinates should be.

##### The Breakthrough

My breakthrough happened when I just kept scrolling through P5.js references and messing with the shapes.
I started having fun with it once I really started practicing patience with myself and allowed myself to make mistakes.
I also discovered what it's like to make a small coding error. I thought about how frustrating it would be if I had more code on my page.
Luckily my mistake was easily found, I had just missed an 'l' on fill.
