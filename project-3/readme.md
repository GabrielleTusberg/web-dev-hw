Project 3 Readme

Gabrielle Tusberg

Project Plans/ Design Plans:

I am going to be doing a music/blog style of a website. I wanted to document my creative process with writing music to ultimately get in touch with other people who enjoy writing and playing music. The about will describe how I like to write what I've been listening to lately or what has been inspiring me in general. I'd also like to upload a current song I"m working on. Playing around with fun typography for presenting the lyrics. Photos will be added as well but not be the main focus I'd like to include mainly graphics for any art for aestetic.

Frustrations and Successes:

I don't even want to tell you guys how long it took me to get that navigation bar to look the way I wanted it. Tons of research and an unfortunately large amount of time pulling my hair out, I finally got it. It may or may not be 3:30am right now. Okay, it is. It really is, but let's not judge my sleep schedule. It's awful, I know.

Update: It's now 5:30am but I really want to get this done. I'm excited to see it all coming together!

I've found that doing my CSS while creating the HTML portion is working really well for me, rather than doing them separately. That way I can section out each bit of my CSS in order of how things appear in my HTML. It also let's me play around with how things are looking bit by bit, instead of worrying about screwing something up at the end!

Progress! - Sample.html done!

insert happy screaming here, I finished my sample page! It's so cute! It's kind of simple, but honestly, I think it works! Onwards to other pages!

Index.html Complete!

I realize that seems very backwards to do the index second, but I wasn't sure what I was going to write yet for the sample page, so I did them in reverse.

About.html and Contact.html Complete!

These were actually fairly easy, which I'm thankful for. I'm really happy with how everything's looking though!

Project Wrap-Up Thoughts

That wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. It certainly took longer than I expected, but once I really got focused and figured out my plan, it was pretty easy going from there. And I'm pretty sure I managed to make sure all requirements were met! That was a big project, but I'm super happy with how it turned out!
