###Project 3 Readme

Gabrielle Tusberg

Project Plans/ Design Plans:

I am going to be doing a music/blog style of a website. I wanted to document my creative process with writing music to ultimately get in touch with other people who enjoy writing and playing music. The about will describe how I like to write what I've been listening to lately or what has been inspiring me in general. I'd also like to upload a current song I"m working on. Playing around with fun typography for presenting the lyrics. Photos will be added as well but not be the main focus I'd like to include mainly graphics for any art for aestetic.

Color Palette for Project 3:
Thinking about trying to stick with primary colors in a logo I will use. As for the layout want those background colors to be prretty simple.

Frustrations and Successes:

This font code is not working! Justine just helped me and I got home and already broke it. All I did was try and upload another font. So instead I'm just importing them and thats been working much better. I'm also having a difficult time figuring out the layout and what it all means. I dont know why the "features" are called "article" in my css and I dont know how to personalize each feature colum as well as switch up the dimensions.

Okay, finally got the home page to "work" but it's not doing what its techincally suppose to. The main menu on the home page is suppose to be flating on the left hand side and I'm not sure why I can't get it to do that so for now I"m settling. Ultimately cant wait for this to be done but I want it to look good so I'm torn.
