## Summary
This week I was intimidated about all the reading but once I started flipping through the book and saw how each page was written I was like, "okay I can do this." I was a bit confused on some of the things like what the meta meant exactly and if I was doing it right. I really just copied the example. I also wasn't sure if I was organizing my code correctly. I had some high expectations for myself at first I thought I was going to create a bit more of an intricate web page but ultimately I'm glad I lowered them because with just what I have I learned a lot. The book helped tremendously and I'm really glad I had the physical copy.

### Issues
I can't figure out how to change my font color and background color. Also there's an issue in the first paragraph where the first half of the text is gray and the other half is black. It's all suppose to be the same paragraph but there is an unordered list I put in the middle of it and I'm wondering if that's what is messing up the color.
