## Summary
This week had a lot of material and it was also great practice. I used a lot of different elements I had not used before and really got into trying to create my own web site. In the future I'm looking forward to making it more unique and really incorporating all the tools learned this week. Including getting an actual server if people want to fill out a "survey" or "log in", since I'm not entirely sure mine actually works.

### Issues
I still would like to understand more about the layout and styling the webpage its self. I think that will be later down the road. I was just having difficulties trying to refelect my one of my images on top of my Intrusctions page.
